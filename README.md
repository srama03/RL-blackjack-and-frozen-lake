## Reinforcement Learning for Blackjack and Frozen Lake

### Introduction
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for solving decision-making problems. This project applies RL techniques to train agents for two environments: Blackjack and Frozen Lake. Using Q-learning and value iteration, the agents learn strategies to maximize rewards in these stochastic settings.

### Objective
The project aims to:

* Train a Blackjack-playing agent using Q-learning.
* Optimize policy for Frozen Lake using value iteration.
* Achieve high success rates in stochastic environments.
  
### Key Features
* Implemented Q-learning for Blackjack in Gymnasiumâ€™s simulation environment.
* Used model-based reinforcement learning for policy optimization in Frozen Lake.
* Visualized training performance and success rates.
  
### Tech Stack
* Python
* Gymnasium
* NumPy
